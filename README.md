# Assembly-Use-PIC-micro-MCU-and-7-segDisp-to-display-0-9-in-each-cell



Note more info is in the attached word doc


Brief:
About - we will be using the PIC micro MCU type: 16F88 and a 7-segment display to show the numbers 0 to 9 in each cell 
We will use set Port B to output mode.
A short delay subroutine is called after each led on/off step
Assembler directives will be used 
A "look up table " will be used to find the corresponding hex code for showing number X on the display. 
To find out how the hex code was figured out use: https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/7-segment-display-tutorial.html
